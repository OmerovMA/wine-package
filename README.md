This repository contains an MLOps project for predicting wine quality using machine learning. The project demonstrates best practices for developing, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models in production.

- Machine learning model for wine quality prediction
- REST API endpoint for predictions
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Docker containerization
- Code quality checks (Flake8, Pylint)
- Pre-commit hooks for code standardization
- Unit and integration tests

Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker (optional)
- pip
